While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.\r\n\r\n### Run\r\n\r\nIn a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:\r\n\r\n```ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb```  \r\n```jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb```\r\n\r\nThis will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.\r\n\r\n## Data\r\n\r\nThe dataset used in this project is included as `student-data.csv`. This dataset has the following attributes:\r\n\r\n- `school` : student's school (binary: \"GP\" or \"MS\")\r\n- `sex` : student's sex (binary: \"F\" - female or \"M\" - male)\r\n- `age` : student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)\r\n- `address` : student's home address type (binary: \"U\" - urban or \"R\" - rural)\r\n- `famsize` : family size (binary: \"LE3\" - less or equal to 3 or \"GT3\" - greater than 3)\r\n- `Pstatus` : parent's cohabitation status (binary: \"T\" - living together or \"A\" - apart)\r\n- `Medu` : mother's education (numeric: 0 - none,  1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education)\r\n- `Fedu` : father's education (numeric: 0 - none,  1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education)\r\n- `Mjob` : mother's job (nominal: \"teacher\", \"health\" care related, civil \"services\" (e.g. administrative or police), \"at_home\" or \"other\")\r\n- `Fjob` : father's job (nominal: \"teacher\", \"health\" care related, civil \"services\" (e.g. administrative or police), \"at_home\" or \"other\")\r\n- `reason` : reason to choose this school (nominal: close to \"home\", school \"reputation\", \"course\" preference or \"other\")\r\n- `guardian` : student's guardian (nominal: \"mother\", \"father\" or \"other\")\r\n- `traveltime` : home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - <15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - >1 hour)\r\n- `studytime` : weekly study time (numeric: 1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - >10 hours)\r\n- `failures` : number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4)\r\n- `schoolsup` : extra educational support (binary: yes or no)\r\n- `famsup` : family educational support (binary: yes or no)\r\n- `paid` : extra paid classes within the course subject (Math or Portuguese) (binary: yes or no)\r\n- `activities` : extra-curricular activities (binary: yes or no)\r\n- `nursery` : attended nursery school (binary: yes or no)\r\n- `higher` : wants to take higher education (binary: yes or no)\r\n- `internet` : Internet access at home (binary: yes or no)\r\n- `romantic` : with a romantic relationship (binary: yes or no)\r\n- `famrel` : quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent)\r\n- `freetime` : free time after school (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)\r\n- `goout` : going out with friends (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)\r\n- `Dalc` : workday alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)\r\n- `Walc` : weekend alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)\r\n- `health` : current health status (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good)\r\n- `absences` : number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93)\r\n- `passed` : did the student pass the final exam (binary: yes or no)\r\n# student_intervention\r\n",
